            History
        </h2>
    </p>

   <p> The history of 
       Paris dates back to approximately 
       259 BC, with the Parisii, 
       a Celtic tribe settled on the banks 
       of the Seine. In 52 BC, the 
       fishermen village was conquered by 
       the Romans, founding a 
       Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia. The city changed
       its name to Paris during the fourth century.

           Guide to Public Transportation

       </h2>

   </p>

   <p>
    Paris boasts one of the 
    world's safest and most 
    efficient public 
    transportation systems. 
    While the metro subway 
    system is extensive, 
    it's generally safe 
    and easy to use once you 
    familiarize yourself with 
    it a bit. Trains usually 
    arrive on time; buses are 
    well-appointed and spacious, 
    and commuter express (RER) 
    trains service the city's 
    most important stops in record time.

    The Paris city government 
    takes public transport 
    very seriously, and every 
    year a big chunk of the 
    budget is reserved for 
    improving traffic and 
    passenger conditions 
    in Paris trains, 
    buses, and tramways. 
    In the coming years, 
    you can expect Paris 
    public transportation 
    to become more efficient, 
    accessible and comfortable. 
    Lots of new stations are 
    also being added, making 
    it easier than ever to get around.

            Must Have Packing List When Visiting Paris
        </h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Backpack
            <p>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don’t take a big bag for 
                    your trip to Paris! 
                    Remember that at the 
                    entry of every 
                    monument or touristic place you will 
                    have to open it, and sometimes 
                    even empty it.
                    Instead of that, c
                    hoose a small 
                    backpack that’s 
                    comfortable and 
                    easy to carry, and where 
                    you can put everything you 
                    need for your journey in 
                    Paris: a bottle of water, 
                    your documents, your camera 
                    and an umbrella.

                    By doing so you won’t 
                    have a bulky bag to 
                    worry about all the 
                    journey, and you will 
                    save some time during the 
                    security checks.
                    Advice: be careful with your 
                    backpack, especially on public 
                    transport, and beware of 
                    pickpockets.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Of course! If you’re going 
                    to visit one of the most 
                    beautiful cities in Europe, 
                    the first thing to pack is 
                    your camera.

                    Choose one according 
                    to your needs, and 
                    remember that the 
                    smaller it is, the e
                    asier it is to carry.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p></p>

        <li>
            Power Bank 
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don’t board the plane 
                    without one of these!

                    With a power bank, 
                    you can charge your 
                    phone (or another device) 
                    without a plug.

                    There are different 
                    sizes, shapes and powers; 
                    choose one according to 
                    your needs, but pay 
                    attention to the size.

                    Make sure it’s not 
                    too big because then it 
                    won’t fit in your pocket. 
                    And don’t forget the USB 
                    cable that comes with the 
                    power bank!

                    With this device, you can 
                    use your cellphone 
                    without worry, because 
                    you know that if you 
                    are running out of battery, 
                    you can always count on 
                    this device to save the day!

            Universal Adaptor
            <p></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you don’t live 
                    in Europe, and 
                    even if you live 
                    there (it might be 
                    useful sometimes), 
                    think about buying 
                    an universal adaptor before 
                    leaving your 
                    country.
                    There are different models; some of them simpler than others, so choose one according to your needs.

                    You can find some 
                    adaptors designed o
                    nly for European 
                    plugs and some 
                    others that you can 
                    use almost everywhere.

                    The former is simpler and 
                    cheaper (about €3), while the 
                    latter perform better and is 
                    more expensive (about €10), so 
                    make your choice.

                    Yes, it might sound 
                    a little bit 
                    strange, but a 
                    photo ID (about 
                    45 mm x 35 mm) 
                    can be very useful.

                    You may wonder what 
                    you are gonna do 
                    with that photo, 
                    well the answer is 
                    simple: you’re 
                    going to paste it 
                    on your Navigo 
                    pass, the Parisian 
                    travel pass, and by 
                    doing so, you’re 
                    going to save some 
                    money.

                    It is always a good 
                    idea to have some 
                    cash with you, but 
                    not too much!

                    That’s why it is 
                    useful to take 
                    your credit card 
                    with you.

                    In France, like in 
                    most European 
                    countries, you 
                    can pay by card 
                    almost everywhere.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Even if the Parisian transport system works quite well, journeys on a train can be long sometimes.

                    So in order to make your journey more comfortable and pleasant, pack your headphones.

                    That will help you to relax during your trip, and could be very useful if you’re thinking about taking a bus or a train to your next destination.
